The Text2SpeechEditor folder is the Eclpise Project folder that contains
all source code relevant to the project (including JUnit test code) as well as
a pre-compiled .jar app of the project, just in case it is needed.

The UML_source_images folder contains the original images of the UML diagrams used in the report,
just in case the images in the report itself are too hard to read.

SprintReport-v1.pdf is a pdf file that contains the required report on the project.
